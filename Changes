Revision history for Perl extension {{$dist->name}}

{{$NEXT}} (TRIAL)
    - Removed is_closing()
    - Removed is_active()
    - Removed loop_configure()
    - Removed loop_alive()
    - Removed reference to UV::Poll->new_socket() as that's all done in the
      standard ->new() constructor now.
    - Updated documentation for the Handle classes to better indicate their
      use.
    - Removed extra library detection for windows as this is now done in
      Alien::libuv
    - Bumped the requirement of Alien::libuv to 1.000
    - Removed some bad Poll tests

    - Removed Moo requirements

1.000005  2018-01-28 (TRIAL)
    - Update 02-loop-alive.t to more closely resemble libuv's
    - Remove lib/p5uv_handles.h (no longer needed)
    - Remove lib/p5uv_loops.h (no longer needed)
    - Ensure all Handle objects call ->_destruct() on destruction rather than
      just calling close.
    - Provide the current "closed" state of the handle to its destructor to
      assist with knowing when to free safely.
    - Rename Loop->_destroy() to Loop->_destruct() to be consistent
    - Make Loop->_destroy() use p5uv_destroy_loop() to free properly
    - A few changes at the suggestion of Devel::PPPort
    - Added a few more tests to ensure we can export things correctly
    - Added a UV::check() function. A convenience wrapper to UV::Check->new
    - Added a UV::idle() function. A convenience wrapper to UV::Idle->new
    - Added a UV::poll() function. A convenience wrapper to UV::Poll->new
    - Added a UV::prepare() function. A convenience wrapper to UV::Prepare->new
    - Reworked the tests to exercise the above convenience wrappers
    - Removed a few superfluous 'use' statements

1.000004  2018-01-25 (TRIAL)
    - Require at least ExtUtils::MakeMaker v7.12 for XSMULTI
    - Move all *.[ch] into lib with the module using XSMULTI (mohawk)
    - Redesign everything
    - Now using XS::Object::Magic to hide the C structs within our Perl objects
    - Now using Moo

    - Pretty much a complete-rewrite from v1.000003

1.000003  2017-10-26 (TRIAL)
    - Don't store Loop stashes globally (thread safety)
    - Moved constant declarations / some de-dupe efforts (Thanks Paul Evans)
    - Added Perl context to all functions that call the Perl API
    - Separated loop and handle functions from the XS interface

1.000002  2017-09-24 (TRIAL)
    - Don't store Handle stashes globally for Handle types (thread safety)
    - Simplified the typemap
    - Removed UV::default_loop from UV.xs and added to UV.pm instead
    - Renamed some macros to make more sense.
    - Removed unused macros

1.000001  2017-08-17 (TRIAL)
    - Update some prereqs
    - Remove use of SO_REUSEPORT in the tests. We store the port already.
